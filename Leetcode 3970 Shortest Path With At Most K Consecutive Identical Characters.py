Leetcode 3970 Shortest Path With At Most K Consecutive Identical Characters
 
You are given an integer n representing the number of nodes in a directed weighted graph, numbered from 0 to n - 1. This is represented by a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] represents a directed edge from node ui to node vi with weight wi.

You are also given a string labels of length n, where labels[i] is the character assigned to node i, and an integer k.

Return the minimum total edge weight of a path from node 0 to node n - 1 such that the concatenation of the labels of the nodes along the path contains at most k consecutive identical characters. If no valid path exists, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[0,2,3]], labels = "aab", k = 1

Output: 3

Explanation:

The optimal valid path from node 0 to node 2 is as follows:

Use edges[2] = [0, 2, 3] to reach node 2 with a weight wi = 3.
The corresponding concatenation of labels is "ab", which satisfies at most k = 1 consecutive identical characters. Thus, the answer is 3.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[0,2,3]], labels = "aab", k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation:

The optimal valid path from node 0 to node 2 is as follows:

Use edges[0] = [0, 1, 1] to reach node 1 with weight wi = 1.
Use edges[1] = [1, 2, 1] to reach node 2 with weight wi = 1.
The corresponding concatenation of labels is "aab", which satisfies at most k = 2 consecutive identical characters. Thus, the answer is 2.
Example 3:

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1]], labels = "aaa", k = 2

Output: -1

Explanation:

There is no valid path from node 0 to node 2 that satisfies at most k = 2 consecutive identical characters. Thus, the answer is -1.

 

Constraints:

1 <= n == labels.length <= 5 * 104
0 <= edges.length <= 5 * 104
edges[i] == [ui, vi, wi]
0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1
ui != vi
1 <= wi <= 104
labels consists of lowercase English letters
1 <= k <= 50
