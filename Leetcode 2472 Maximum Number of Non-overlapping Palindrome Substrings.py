Leetcode 2472 Maximum Number of Non-overlapping Palindrome Substrings
 
You are given a string s and a positive integer k.

Select a set of non-overlapping substrings from the string s that satisfy the following conditions:

The length of each substring is at least k.
Each substring is a palindrome.
Return the maximum number of substrings in an optimal selection.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abaccdbbd", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: We can select the substrings underlined in s = "abaccdbbd". Both "aba" and "dbbd" are palindromes and have a length of at least k = 3.
It can be shown that we cannot find a selection with more than two valid substrings.
Example 2:

Input: s = "adbcda", k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no palindrome substring of length at least 2 in the string.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= s.length <= 2000
s consists of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def maxPalindromes(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        is_palindrome = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]

        for length in range(1, n + 1):
            for left in range(n - length + 1):
                right = left + length - 1
                is_palindrome[left][right] = s[left] == s[right] and (
                    length <= 2 or is_palindrome[left + 1][right - 1]
                )

        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1]
            for j in range(i - k + 1):
                if is_palindrome[j][i - 1]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

        return dp[n]
