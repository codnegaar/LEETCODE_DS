Leetcode 3660 Jump Game IX

You are given an integer array nums.

From any index i, you can jump to another index j under the following rules:

Jump to index j where j > i is allowed only if nums[j] < nums[i].
Jump to index j where j < i is allowed only if nums[j] > nums[i].
For each index i, find the maximum value in nums that can be reached by following any sequence of valid jumps starting at i.

Return an array ans where ans[i] is the maximum value reachable starting from index i.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,3]

Output: [2,2,3]

Explanation:

For i = 0: No jump increases the value.
For i = 1: Jump to j = 0 as nums[j] = 2 is greater than nums[i].
For i = 2: Since nums[2] = 3 is the maximum value in nums, no jump increases the value.
Thus, ans = [2, 2, 3].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,1]

Output: [3,3,3]

Explanation:

For i = 0: Jump forward to j = 2 as nums[j] = 1 is less than nums[i] = 2, then from i = 2 jump to j = 1 as nums[j] = 3 is greater than nums[2].
For i = 1: Since nums[1] = 3 is the maximum value in nums, no jump increases the value.
For i = 2: Jump to j = 1 as nums[j] = 3 is greater than nums[2] = 1.
Thus, ans = [3, 3, 3].

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109

class Solution:

        n = len(nums)

        pre = [0] * n

        # suffix min
        suf[-1] = nums[-1]
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            suf[i] = min(suf[i + 1], nums[i])

        res[-1] = pre[-1]

        # build answer
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):

            # merge segment
            if pre[i] > suf[i + 1]:
                res[i] = res[i + 1]

            # new segment
            else:
                res[i] = pre[i]

        return res
